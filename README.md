# Applications
->Vedic Multiplier is a key tool in rapidly growing technology especially in the immense domain of Image processing, Digital Signal Processing, real-time signal. 
->Multipliers are important block in digital systems and play a critical role in digital designs. Along with accuracy demand for minimizing time area, power, and delay of the processor by enhancing speed is the focus point.
->Vedic mathematics rules and Algorithms generate partial products concurrently and save time. This paper is a review of the application and modification of Vedic multiplier in different fields and a comparison of Vedic multiplier with other multipliers for enhancing performance parameters.
